# Bank of England – Employer-Led Analytics Project (Group)

**Context:** Employer project delivered as part of the LSE Data Analytics Career Accelerator  
**Focus:** Text analytics · Time series context · Stakeholder communication

---

## Project Overview

Worked as part of a multidisciplinary analytics team on an employer-led project analysing sentiment in central bank communications and how it relates to macroeconomic and financial indicators.

The project explored whether central bank communication tone reflects economic conditions and market stress across stable periods and major shocks (e.g. Global Financial Crisis, COVID-19).

## My Contribution

- Exploratory analysis of sentiment metrics over time  
- Interpretation of communication tone in economic context  
- Supporting analysis linking sentiment to macro indicators  
- Co-developing insights and narrative for a stakeholder-facing pitch

## Key Takeaway

Central bank communication sentiment aligns strongly with economic stress during crisis periods, but shows weaker and non-linear relationships during stable periods — highlighting the need for judgement alongside quantitative metrics.

- Experience working on a real employer brief  
- Collaboration in a multi-analyst team  
- Communicating nuanced, non-linear insights to stakeholders  
- Operating under ambiguity with imperfect data
