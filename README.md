# Hi, I’m Tom Brown 👋

I’m a **Business Analytics undergraduate** with hands-on experience delivering **data-driven insights** across public-sector, commercial, and employer-led projects.

I completed the **LSE Data Analytics Career Accelerator**, where I worked on real-world analytics problems using Python, SQL, R, Tableau, and Excel — including an employer-led project with the Bank of England.

I focus on:
- turning messy data into clear, decision-ready insights,
- communicating results to technical and business stakeholders,
- and using analytics to support better operational and strategic decisions.

 **Roles I’m targeting:** Data Analyst · Business Analyst · Analytics Intern  
 **Tools:** Python · SQL · R · Tableau · Excel
