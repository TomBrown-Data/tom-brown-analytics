# Customer Segmentation & Loyalty Modelling (Turtle Games)

**Tools:** Python, R  
**Focus:** Customer analytics · Segmentation · Predictive modelling

## Problem

Turtle Games, a global games retailer, wanted to improve sales performance by better understanding customer loyalty behaviour.

The key questions were:
- What factors drive customer loyalty?
- Can customers be segmented into meaningful groups?
- How can insights be used to support targeted marketing strategies?

---

## Data

The analysis uses customer demographic data, purchasing behaviour, loyalty points, and customer reviews.

Both Python and R were used to explore, model, and validate findings.

---

## Approach

- Explored distributions and relationships within loyalty data
- Built regression models to identify key loyalty drivers
- Applied clustering techniques to segment customers into actionable groups
- Used sentiment analysis on customer reviews as a supporting signal
- Validated findings across tools (Python and R)

---

## Key Insights

- Customer spending behaviour is the strongest predictor of loyalty.
- Demographic factors such as age show weaker relationships than expected.
- Customers naturally group into distinct segments with different loyalty and value profiles.
- Customer sentiment provides useful qualitative context but is a secondary driver.

---

## Recommendations

1. Introduce tiered loyalty rewards aligned to spending behaviour.
2. Focus retention efforts on high-value customer segments.
3. Use targeted promotions to move mid-tier customers upwards.
4. Incentivise customer reviews to strengthen engagement feedback loops.

## Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates the ability to combine statistical analysis, segmentation, and business interpretation to support customer-focused decision-making in a commercial setting.

## Next Steps

Potential extensions to this analysis include:
- Testing alternative clustering methods to compare segment stability
- Incorporating longitudinal behaviour to track loyalty changes over time
- Evaluating the impact of targeted promotions on segment movement
